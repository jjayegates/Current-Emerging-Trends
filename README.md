- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, I was given code that basically created the state data for me and created the mechanism of remembering past actions and results.  The portion I had to create myself was the actual training of the data.  I utilized book research and the provided pseudocode in order to complete the project.  

- Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  - What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists essentially talk to computers.  They speak a language that computers can understand and give them tasks to do so that those tasks can be completed faster and more efficient than they would have been completed if done by a human being.  
  
  - How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  As a computer scientists, the most important part of approaching a problem is developing an algorithm, or a plan of action.  A step-by-step strategy of converting a problem into a solution.  In my opinion, the ability to do this is more important than proficiency in the language of choice itself.  If the plan is granular enough, each step can be translated from english into code using a little bit of researhc, even with a beginner's level undertanding of the language.  However it is much more difficult to use research to compensate for the lack of an algorithm.  Especially if the problem you are trying to solve is not a common problem. 
  
  - What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  The most important ethical responsibliity I have to the end user and organization is to deliver a product that fucntions as expected and requested.  Complete honesty and transparancy is paramount, especially when you consider the fact that most end users and organizational heads are going to be far less familiar with computer science topics than the actual computer scientists will be.  The potnetial of abuse and dishonesty is high and making sure the scientist in qeustion is of upstanding moral charachter and abides by these ethical respnsibilities is a must.
